		I am a 24 year old Computer Science student working as a Software Engineer. I am working on a degree in Computer Science from RIT. I enjoy music, cooking, programming, and playing video games - mostly Minecraft and RuneScape.

I do enjoy programming and scripting in my free time and have been trying to get better at actually posting the things that I make on Github. If you want to take a look, you can find that here. If you are looking for information about my other programming or work experience you can view my resume here.

Other things about me, I played piano for over 13 years, I ran Track and Cross Country for 6 years, and my favorite TV show is Top Gear (followed closely by Doctor Who and Sherlock...)
