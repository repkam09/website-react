            <h2>Greetings! I'm Mark.</h2>
            </br>
            <p>I am a 25 year old Software Engineer. I graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology with a BS in Computer Science and am currently working as a Windows Printer Driver developer at Kodak Alaris.
                I have also worked on web application projects mostly using ReactJS for frontend user interfaces with Nodejs as a backend.
                I enjoy <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/repkam09">music</a>, <a href="/recipes/">cooking </a>, programming, and
                playing video games - mostly Minecraft, RuneScape, and Rocket League.</p>

            <p>I do enjoy programming and scripting in my free time and have been trying to get better at actually posting the
                things that I make on Github. If you want to take a look, you can find that <a href="https://github.com/repkam09">here</a>.
                If you are looking for information about my other programming or work experience you can view my resume
                <a href="/files/resume.pdf">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Other things about me, I played piano for over 13 years, I ran Track and Cross Country for 6 years, and my favorite
                TV show is Top Gear (followed closely by Doctor Who and Rick and Morty...)</p>

            <p>This server is hosted by <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>, who I highly recommend if
                you are looking for a Virtual Private Server!</p>
